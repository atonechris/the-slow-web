            <h2>What Is This All About?</h2>

            <p>The web moves at an incredible pace, and increasingly services are being demanded live. With a live web, users have come to expect real-time (or close to) feedback. Indeed, by the virtue of being consumer to web services, one finds oneself inundated by notifications and feedback from said services. Welcome to the fast web. Your attention is required now. Here, and there, and everywhere.</p>

            <p>The slow web is hence simply this: it is not the fast web.</p>
            <p>It is our belief that the Slow Web movement, like the <a href="http://www.slowfood.com/about_us/eng/manifesto.lasso" target = "_blank">Slow Food movement</a>, is a truly progressive way forward.</p>
